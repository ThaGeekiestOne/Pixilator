### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThaGeekiestOne/Pixilator.git
   cd Pixilator

2. **📥 Install All Required Packages**

   *Run this command inside the project folder:*

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  **🧱 Install `tkinter` (If Needed)**

      This app uses a graphical interface, which relies on `tkinter`. If it's missing, install it manually:

     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3-tk
   
   - **Arch:**
     
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S tk

   - **Windows: tkinter is usually included with Python, so no extra installation is needed.**

    ```bash
    python3 main.py  
# Pixilator
